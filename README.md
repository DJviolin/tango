Tango
===

Tango is an experimental WordPress theme that uses the [React UI library](https://facebook.github.io/react/) in conjunction with standard [Underscores](http://underscores.me) template files. The goal is to develop a method for adding the magic of JavaScript-based UIs to existing WordPress themes, built in PHP.

Requires the [WP API Theming](https://github.com/kwight/wp-api-theming) plugin.
